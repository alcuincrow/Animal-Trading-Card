			<p class="facts"> In general these are very aggressive frogs. When disturbed, they inflate themselves and stand on their outstretched limbs to appear larger. If this fails to deter a potential predator, they begin to lunge, bite, and then emit a piercing shriek.</p>

			<p>A  large, stout, aquatic frog with a dorsoventrally flattened body.  In both sexes the head is large and robust, composing approximately 1/3 of the total body length, and broad to make room for the extraordinarily wide jaws of these animals. There are large teeth on the upper jaw and two large medially placed teeth or fangs on the lower jaw. The nostrils and eyes are dorsally positioned, the pupils are rhomboidal and the tympanum is distinct. The forelimbs and hind limbs are short, and the forelimbs are held forward while swimming. </p>
